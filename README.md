## 📌 Project Overview 
This project demonstrates a production-grade, three-tier web architecture deployed on AWS. The infrastructure is fully automated using Terraform, focusing on high availability, security isolation, and scalable data persistence. It bridges enterprise database management with modern cloud-native orchestration.

## 🏗️ Architecture Features
* **VPC Networking:** Public/Private subnet isolation with a verified Internet Gateway (IGW) and custom Route Tables.
* **High Availability:** Application Load Balancer (ALB) distributing traffic across multiple Availability Zones.
* **Auto-Scaling:** Self-healing EC2 fleet (t2.micro) running Apache/PHP.
* **Database Security:** RDS MySQL instance isolated in a private DB Subnet Group.
* **Content Delivery:** Integrated with CloudFront for global edge caching and GoDaddy DNS integration.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **IaC:** Terraform
* **Compute:** Amazon EC2 (Amazon Linux 2023)
* **Networking:** VPC, ALB, IGW, NAT Gateway
* **Database:** Amazon RDS (MySQL)
* **Automation:** GitHub Actions for automated code deployment

## 🧠 Key Troubleshooting Wins (The "DevOps" Journey)
* **The "Smoking Gun" (IGW Routing):** Identified a `504 Gateway Timeout` caused by missing Route Table associations for the Public Subnets. Resolved by mapping `0.0.0.0/0` to the Internet Gateway, enabling the ALB to communicate with the internet.
* **Target Group Health:** Successfully moved Target Group status from "Unhealthy/Initial" to **Healthy (200 OK)** by aligning Security Group rules and VPC routing logic.
* **GitOps Flow:** Implemented an automated deployment pipeline to bridge the local repository with the live AWS environment.

## 🚀 How to Deploy
1. Initialize Terraform: `terraform init`
2. Review Plan: `terraform plan`
3. Deploy Infrastructure: `terraform apply`
4. Verify Connectivity: `curl -I http://[ALB-DNS-NAME]/index.php`
